Once upon a time, a man named James went to the market in order to get milk for his morning cereal. On his way to the store he ran into an old friend named Jessica.
Jessica warned James that there was no more milk at the grocery store that he was going to, and he would actually have to go to another town in order to get milk for his morning cereal. This made James angry, because this is the third time in a month james has had to travel to the other town for milk.

It is really unfortunate that the road is extreme muddy since the recent rainy days. On the way to the third town, he meets a carriage, which is stuck into muddy puddles. Apperently, the two people on the carriage feels powerless since they cann't make the carriage moves with only themselves. However, with the help from James, they get the carriage out of puddles. To appreciate his kindness, the owner of carriage decides to provide James a ride to his destination. 

James thought he was just going to the grocery strore in the next town, but he was proven wrong. The horse and buggy skipped the grocery store and headed towards the bank in the town and the group got out and proceeded to try to hold up the bank with pitchforks and torches. James was then used as a hostage and they escaped with the money from the bank. The two people from the carriage tried to get away with James tied to the back but it was no match for the police cars because this story is actually set in today's time and not when horse and buggy were normal.
